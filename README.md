Project for creating personal internet backup systems


Taking inspiration from Internet-a-box, the plan is to compile necessary hardware and make a personal internet backup for emergency situations. The initial idea includes taking a Single Board Computer, a sturdy case, a solar powered power supply, and other necessary components and combining them into a small device that can be put in a faraday bag to protect the electronics from damage. This device will have an offline version of Wikipedia and many other resources included in the IIAB software. Once a viable device has been developed, it could be sold at a standard retail markup and could generate a modest profit.
